# RetroRunner
RetroRunner is a free, easy-to-use DOSBox front end for Windows. See the [website](https://bsimser.github.io/retrorunner/) for help, screenshots, and details. RetroRunner is based on [CBoxRun](https://cboxrun.wordpress.com/), a WinForms application that no longer works and has been abandoned.
